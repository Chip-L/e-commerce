## User Story

AS A manager at an internet retail company

I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a this app:

```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

```

## Installation

1. Use the schema from [/db/schema.sql](./db/schema.sql) to create the database.
2. npm run seed

## Usage

"npm start" to start the server. There is no frontend.
